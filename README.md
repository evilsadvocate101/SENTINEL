# SCRIPT PASSWORD
When running the script, you will be prompted for a password.
Enter: `swordnub`

## **Requirements**
- **Administrator privileges, private server & channel**.
- [**Isekaid bot**](https://top.gg/bot/989440183428599849).
- **Message-purging bot**, by default: [**Nekotina**](https://top.gg/bot/429457053791158281).
- **One-hit kill character**.

## **Setup Guide** (Important)
### **PC Users**
- Use [**Firefox Developer Edition**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) 
 (prevents throttling). You can use Chrome, Opera, or other browsers, but if you switch tabs, lock your PC, or minimize the browser, the script won’t work. That’s why you should use Firefox Developer Edition—by default, there’s no throttling.
- Enable **hardware acceleration** for smooth performance.

### **Mobile Users** (Android only)
- Use [**Kiwi Browser**](https://apkpure.com/kiwi-browser-fast-quiet/com.kiwibrowser.browser)
PS: Kiwi Browser has already been archived from the Play Store, but you can find the APK file on APKPure or other mirror sites. If you have another mobile browser option, that’s fine too—as long as it has a developer console.
- Use [**SwiftKey Keyboard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey) (Google Keyboard has paste limits).
- Keep the script running by minimizing the browser or using split-screen mode.

## **Additional Information**
- **Load Settings**: You can customize the settings based on your preferences. If you're unsure, follow the default settings:  
  Default setting: `"neko purge 1000;kraken-tempura;retainer:yes"`  
  Format: `"x1;x2;x3:yes"`

  **Explanation**:
  - `x1` = Purging command for the bot you are using.
  - `x2` = Type of food buff you want to use.
  - `x3` = Auto-collect retainer every 6 hours (set to `yes` or `no`).
